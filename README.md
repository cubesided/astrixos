###### still being worked on, no installer yet :P
Here holds the operating system for, the **cubesided** Astrix<br>

## Quick Rundown:
Each version of Astrix OS is labeled as:<br>
OSr* (with the asterisk being what version number it is)<br>
eg. cubesided OSr2<br>

> [!NOTE]  
> Even though its labeled as Astrix OS, **DO NOT** put Astrix infront of the OSr*.
